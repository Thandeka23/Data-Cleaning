# Data Handling and Analysis with Python

## Project Title: Exploring Real-World Data Using Python

### Objective
This project focuses on using Python for basic data handling, cleaning, and analysis. The dataset used is the **StudentPerformanceFactors** dataset, obtained from an open-source data repository (Kaggle). The project aims to reinforce fundamental data skills in preparation for more advanced tasks in the upcoming CompTIA Data+ training.
